Dimensionality Reduction

SVD factorizes a matrix into three matrices:U, Σ, and V
A=UΣVT,
U is an orthonormal matrix, whose columns are called left singular vectors
U是一个正交矩阵，它的列被称为左奇异向量

Σ is a diagonal matrix with non-negative diagonals in descending order, whose diagonals are called singular values
Σ是一个依次为非负矩阵的对角线，对角线称为奇异

V is an orthonormal matrix, whose columns are called right singular vectors
V是一个正交矩阵，其列称为右奇异向量

factorization因式分解

The singular values and the right singular vectors are derived from the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the Gramian matrix ATA
